The contents of this file provide the description for the micro-library's NuGet package. Due to the limitations of NuGet, it's important to keep this description to a single short paragraph, and avoid "unfriendly" characters (especially semicolons!). If in doubt, you can test the resulting package using [NuGet Package Explorer](https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer).
